Changes in version 1.26:

While writing the mapfile, ddrescue now checks the return value of each call
to 'fprintf' to catch any temporary failure of 'fprintf' not reported by the
system when closing the file. (Hole in mapfile reported by Radomír Tomis).

Domain mapfiles may now contain unordered and overlapping blocks when
'-L, --loose-domain' is specified as long as no block overlaps with other
block of different status. (Suggested by Gábor Katona and Shaya Potter).

Ddrescue now shows the file name in all the diagnostics with a file involved.
(Reported by Radomír Tomis).

Ddrescue now exits with status 1 on fatal read errors.
(Suggested by Marco Marques).

Empty phases are now completely skipped.

Ddrescue now scrolls forward after each pass. This keeps on the screen the
final status of the previous pass, making it easier to estimate the amount
of work done by the current pass. (Based on a suggestion by David Morrison).

In case of error in a numerical argument to a command line option, ddrescue
now shows the name of the option and the range of valid values.

The option synonyms '--*-logfile' and '--pause' have been removed and are no
longer recognized.

Ddrescuelog now can convert between mapfiles and bitmaps of blocks (big and
little endian). The new option '-F, --format' has been added to ddrescuelog.
It selects the input format for '--create-mapfile', or the output format for
'--list-blocks'. (Bitmap format proposed by Florian Sedivy).

Option '-d, --delete-if-done' of ddrescuelog no longer returns an error if
the mapfile is read from standard input. Instead it behaves like
'-D, --done-status' because there is nothing to delete.

'ddrescuelog --show-status' now rounds percentages up to get the sum closer
to 100%.

Three missing '#include <algorithm>' have been added.
(Reported by Richard Burkert).

The description of the algorithm in the manual has been improved.
